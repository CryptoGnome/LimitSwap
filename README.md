LimitSwap is a trading bot for UniSwap & Many Other DEXs. It has the ability to scan multiple pairs on uniswap and grab the price in realtime and make automated trading decisions based on the users settings [AKA: Limit Orders]


*This bot was built as a learning project for me to learn how to use Web.py, Erc20, & improve my coding skills please use at your own risk!*

## Install LimitSwap
There are 2 ways to install LimitSwap : 

### 1/ Download the pre-compiled package 
That we provide on the Release page : it's a .exe file that you can run on your computer.
- Pros : very easy to setup
- Cons : it's pre-compiled, so you cannot check the Source Code


### 2/ Compile yourself the Source Code
Here is a tutorial step-by-step: 
- Download last LimitSwap code here :
