# LimitSwap
LimitSwap is a trading bot for UniSwap & Many Other DEXs. It has the ability to scan multiple pairs on uniswap and grab the price in realtime and make automated trading decisions based on the users settings [AKA: Limit Orders]


*This bot was built as a learning project for me to learn how to use Web.py, Erc20, & improve my coding skills please use at your own risk!*
